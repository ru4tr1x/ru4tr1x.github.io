The air is perfumed with the scent of wild garlic, while white-throated dippers, wagtails, and treecreepers observe as you navigate through waterfalls and natural swimming pools.

Those who venture down to the river might catch sight of the waterfall deep within the cave, marvelling at the adventures that lie ahead.
