                <h1>What we do</h1>
                <p>Scotland's Canyons are hidden and ancient temples, to explore them is to discover a special place. Canyoning is swimming, climbing, jumping and sliding down a stream as it plunges through a rocky chasm. We introduce specialised harnesses, carabiners and ropes and use them to discover deep pools and majestic waterfalls. We will help you discover Scotlands Canyons, the joy of canyoning and possibly something new about yourself along the way.</p>

                <h1>Our Equipment</h1>
                <p>One of the easiest things to control on any adventure is the clothing and equipment you use. It's more fun Canyoning when you are comfortable so we use and maintain the highest standards of gear to keep you warm and secure.</p>

                <h1>Your Safety</h1>
                <p>For us safety is more than a goal, it is a necessity of operation. If it isn't safe we won't do it. Powered by adventure logic we will never take unnecessary risks. We practise with our peers regularly in order to maintain the highest standards of professionalism and be prepared when things don't go to plan with relevant first aid training and incident management.</p>
