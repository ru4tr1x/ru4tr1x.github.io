        <p>It's natural that as you develop your understanding of canyoning and the equipment involved you will want your own. Over time we will help you choose and source appropriate equipment. In the mean time you are always welcome to hire our premium quality equipment for use in your training sessions. It's more fun canyoning when you are comfortable so we use and maintain only the highest standards of gear to keep our guests warm and secure.</p>
