                <h1>What we do</h1>
                <p>To explore a canyon is to discover a special place. Canyoning is swimming, climbing, jumping and sliding down a stream as it plunges through a rocky chasm. We'll teach you how to use harneses, caribiners and ropes to discover deep pools and majestic waterfalls. Canyons are hidden temples of the natural world, carved in stone by the insessant power of water, it's ancient architect. Scotland has many of these wonderous places to explore, we will help you discover Scotlands Canyons, the joy of canyoning and possibly something new about yourself along the way.</p>
